#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(log n), there are no for loops or recursion in this code, but there is a while loop which will make it logarithmic.

b) O(n log(n)), there is a for loop and a while loop.

c) O(c^n), because this a recursive function.

## Exercise II

#Binart Search Approach, runtime complexity O(log n)

#1 Start off on the middle floor and drop an egg
    
    if the egg breaks then repeat step 1 with the bottom half of the building until floor f is found

    if the egg breaks then repeat step1 with the upper half of the building until floor f is found
